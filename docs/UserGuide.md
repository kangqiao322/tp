(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, InTrack can get your 
internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add p/POSITION`, `POSITION` is a parameter which can be used as `add p/Software Engineer Intern`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]` can be used as `a/1600 Amphitheatre Parkway t/virtual` or as `a/1600 Amphitheatre Parkway`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/urgent`, `t/urgent t/virtual` etc.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `list`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
